# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the BitFrame Framework repository;
1. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement;
1. Send a pull request from each feature branch against the version branch for which your fix is intended.

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows each feature or improvement to be reviewed and merged individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the PSR-2 standard.

## Unit Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. The BitFrame Framework uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for testing.
